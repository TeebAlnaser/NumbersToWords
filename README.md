Overview
numbersToWords is a lightweight JavaScript library that converts numerical values between number 1 to 999999999 into their word equivalents in both English and Arabic. By default, the library converts numbers into English words, but you can easily switch to Arabic by passing an optional language parameter.

example :
numbersToWords(100); // Output: "one hundred"

numbersToWords(100, 'ar'); // Output: "مئة"
